# Egge Space 

### Public Bug / Feature Tracker!

Please add any bugs you encounter in the [issues](https://github.com/egge-space/egge-app-public/issues) tab.  
To see the status of the bugs we're working on and their corresponding priorities, please see the [bugs project](https://github.com/egge-space/egge-app-public/projects/2).
I'm not sure how I want to handle feature requests but for now you can just create them as issues.
